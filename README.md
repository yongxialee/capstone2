## Tech stack 

React will be used for the front-end development of my project and  NodeJS for the backend. This app is designed to be a web-based application. 
## Project Focus:
The goal is to focus on full-stack development of both the front-end and back-end. 
## Project type
This app will be web-based which is for both website and mobile app.
## Project goal
This e-commerce is to allow users to shop, and view the ingredients of each product. Its features include user authentication,  shopping cart functionality, and secure online payment processing. 
## User Demographics
The target users will be people of different ages, backgrounds, and financial conditions ( price range from $15 - $175)
## Data usage 
Product data, user data, and transaction data. 

The product data will be fetched data from internal  APIs (which is hardcoding)into the database system, while user data will be collected from the user register and login form. Transaction data will be created when purchases are successfully made. 

## Project Approach 
There will be three tables for the database: users, products, and transactions. The users’ table consists of the users’ id, first name, last name, email, and password. The products table consists of the product ID, brand, name, image, and ingredients. 
The transaction table consists of username as user ID, product id, quantity, and total price.



## Potential API issues:
There’s a possibility to run into handling RESTful
Secure information:
Users’ passwords will be hashed and stored in salted format. 
App functionality:
register/login/logout, and check out
The individual product can be viewed and added to a cart; checkout and proceed securely online payments 
User flow:
Users can access browsing products without logging in or registering and adding products to the cart (the cart will show the current total rice). However, to proceed with checkout, the user needs to register/login;
